NightwatchCss
============

It's just a fork of WebdriverCss for Nightwatch.js
  - install package with npm
```
$ npm install yoh/nightwatchcss
```
 - use it in your test
```js
var nightwatchcss = require('nightwatchcss');

module.exports = {

  "Init nightwatchcss": function(browser) {
    nightwatchcss.init(browser, {});
  },

  "I am a basic test": function(browser) {
    browser
      .url("http://yoursite.com")
      .assert.title('your title')
      .webdrivercss('homepage', {
        screenWidth: [1024, 720],
        exclude: "#comments, .avatar"
      }, function(err, res){
        console.log('assert nothing');
      })
      .pause(1000)
      .end()
    ;
  }
};

```

__CSS regression testing in WebdriverJS__. This plugin is an automatic regression-testing
tool for [WebdriverJS](http://webdriver.io). It was inspired by [James Cryers](https://github.com/jamescryer)
awesome project called [PhantomCSS](https://github.com/Huddle/PhantomCSS). After
initialization it enhances a WebdriverJS instance with an additional command called
`webdrivercss` and enables the possibility to save screenshots of specific parts of
your application.

#### Never loose track of unwanted CSS changes:

## How does it work?

1. Define areas within your application that should always look the same
2. Use WebdriverJS and WebdriverCSS to write some E2E tests and take screenshots of these areas
3. Continue working on your application or website
4. After a while rerun the tests
5. If desired areas differ from previous taken screenshots an image diff gets generated and you get notified in your tests


### Example

```js
// init WebdriverJS
var client = require('webdriverjs').remote({desiredCapabilities:{browserName: 'chrome'}})
// init WebdriverCSS
require('webdrivercss').init(client);

client
    .init()
    .url('http://example.com')
    .webdrivercss('headerArea',{
        elem: '#header',
        screenWidth: [320,480,640]
    })
    .end();
```

## Install

WebdriverCSS uses GraphicsMagick/ImageMagick for image processing as well as [node-canvas](https://github.com/learnboost/node-canvas)
for comparing and analyzing screenshots with [node-resemble](https://github.com/kpdecker/node-resemble).
To install this package you'll need to have [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/), [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/)
and [Cairo](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki/_pages) preinstalled.

#### Mac OS X using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/)
```sh
$ brew install imagemagick graphicsmagick cairo pkg-config
```

#### Ubuntu using apt-get (not tested)
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick libmagickcore-dev
$ sudo apt-get install graphicsmagick
$ sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev
$ sudo apt-get install pkg-config
```

#### Windows

Download and install executables for [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php)/[GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/download.html)
and [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/download/).

After these dependencies are installed you can install WebdriverCSS via NPM as usual:

```sh
$ npm install webdrivercss
$ npm install webdriverjs # if not already installed
```

## Setup

To use this plugin just call the `init` function and pass the desired WebdriverJS instance
as parameter. Additionally you can define some options to configure the plugin. After that
the `webdrivercss` command will be available only for this instance.

* **screenshotRoot** `String` ( default: *./webdrivercss* )<br>
  path were all screenshots gets saved

* **failedComparisonsRoot** `String` ( default: *./webdrivercss/diff* )<br>
  path were all screenshot diffs gets saved

* **misMatchTolerance** `Number` ( default: *0.05* )<br>
  number between 0 and 100 that defines the degree of mismatch to consider two images as
  identical, increasing this value will decrease test coverage

* **screenWidth** `Numbers[]` ( default: *[]* )<br>
  if set all screenshots will be taken in different screen widths (e.g. for responsive design tests)

The following options might be interesting if you want to syncronize your taken images with
an external API. Checkout the [webdrivercss-adminpanel](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdrivercss-adminpanel)
for more information on that.

* **api** `String`
  URL to API interface
* **user** `String`
  user name (only necessary if API requires Basic Authentification or oAuth)
* **key** `String`
  assigned user key (only necessary if API requires Basic Authentification or oAuth)

### Example

```js
// create a WebdriverJS instance
var client = require('webdriverjs').remote({
    desiredCapabilities: {
        browserName: 'phantomjs'
    }
});

// initialise WebdriverCSS for `client` instance
require('webdrivercss').init(client, {
    // example options
    screenshotRoot: 'my-shots',
    failedComparisonsRoot: 'diffs',
    misMatchTolerance: 0.05,
    screenWidth: [320,480,640,1024]
});
```

## Usage

WebdriverCSS enhances an WebdriverJS instance with an command called `webdrivercss`

`client.webdrivercss('some_id', {options}, callback);`

It provides options that will help you to define your areas exactly and exclude parts
that are unrelevant for design (e.g. content). Additionally it allows you to include
the responsive design in your regression tests easily. The following options are
available:

* **elem** `String`<br>
  only capture a specific DOM element

* **width** `Number`<br>
  define a fixed width for your screenshot

* **height** `Number`<br>
  define a fixed height for your screenshot

* **x** `Number`<br>
  take screenshot at an exact xy postion (requires width/height option)

* **y** `Number`<br>
  take screenshot at an exact xy postion (requires width/height option)

* **exclude** `String|Object`<br>
  exclude frequently changing parts of your screenshot, you can either pass a CSS3 selector
  that queries one or multiple elements or you can define x and y values which stretch
  a rectangle or polygon

* **hide** `String`<br>
  hides all elements queried by given CSS selector (via `visibility: hidden`)

* **excludeAfter** `Object`<br>
  exclude parts after taken screenshot

* **timeout** `Numbers`<br>
  wait a specific amount of time (in `ms`) to take the screenshot (useful if you have to wait
  on loading content)

The following paragraphs will give you a more detailed insight how to use these options properly.

### Let your test fail when screenshots differ

When using this plugin you can decide how to handle design breaks. You can either just work
with the captured screenshots or you could even break your E2E test at this position. The
following example shows how to handle design breaks within E2E tests:

```js
describe('my website should always look the same',function() {

    it('header should look the same',function(done) {
        client
            .url('http://www.example.org')
            .webdrivercss('header', {
                elem: '#header'
            }, function(err,res) {
                assert.equal(err, null);

                // this will break the test if screenshot differ more then 5% from
                // the previous taken image
                assert.equal(res.misMatchPercentage < 5, true);
            })
            .call(done);
    });

    // ...
```

### Define specific areas

The most powerful feature of WebdriverCSS is the possibility to define specific areas
for your regression tests. It is highly recommended to not just make screenshots of the
whole website. This can lead to many failing tests if someone breaks a tiny part of the
design. Additionally your tests will run slower because the CPU has to deal with bigger
images during the image comparison. It's better to have an own screenshot for each
UI component.

You can either use a CSS3 selector to define a DOM element you want to capture or you can
specify x/y coordinates to cover a more exact area.

```js
client
    .url('http://github.com')
    .webdrivercss('githubform', {
        elem: '#site-container > div.marketing-section.marketing-section-signup > div.container > form'
    });
```

Will capture the following:

![alt text](http://webdriver.io/images/webdrivercss/githubform.png "Logo Title Text 1")

**Tip:** do right click on the desired element, then click on `Inspect Element`, then hover
over the desired element in DevTools, open the context menu and click on `Copy CSS Path` to
get the exact CSS selector

The following example uses xy coordinates to capture a more exact area. You should also
pass a screenWidth option to make sure that your xy parameters map perfect on the desired area.

```js
client
    .url('http://github.com')
    .webdrivercss('headerbar', {
        x: 110,
        y: 15,
        width: 980,
        height: 34,
        screenWidth: [1200]
    });
```

### Exclude specific areas

Sometimes it is unavoidable that content gets captured and from time to time this content
will change of course. This would break all tests. To prevent this you can
determine areas, which will get covered in black and will not be considered anymore. Here is
an example:

```js
client
    .url('http://tumblr.com/themes')
    .webdrivercss('irgendwas', {
        exclude: '#theme_garden > div > section.carousel > div.carousel_slides,' +
                 '#theme_garden > div > section:nth-child(3) > div.theme_scroll_wrap,' +
                 '#theme_garden > div > section:nth-child(4) > div.theme_scroll_wrap',
        screenWidth: [1200]
    });
```
![alt text](http://webdriver.io/images/webdrivercss/exclude.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Instead of using a CSS3 selector you can also exclude areas by specifying xy values
which form a rectangle.

```js
client
    .url('http://tumblr.com/themes')
    .webdrivercss('irgendwas', {
        exclude: [{
            x0: 100, y0: 100,
            x1: 300, y1: 200
        }],
        screenWidth: [1200]
    });
```

If your exclude object has more then two xy variables, it will try to form a polygon. This may be
helpful if you like to exclude complex figures like:

```js
client
    .url('http://tumblr.com/themes')
    .webdrivercss('polygon', {
        exclude: [{
            x0: 120, y0: 725,
            x1: 120, y1: 600,
            x2: 290, y2: 490,
            x3: 290, y3: 255,
            x4: 925, y4: 255,
            x5: 925, y5: 490,
            x6: 1080,y6: 600,
            x7: 1080,y7: 725
        }],
        screenWidth: [1200]
    });
```
![alt text](http://webdriver.io/images/webdrivercss/exclude2.png "Logo Title Text 1")

### Keep an eye on mobile screen resolution

It is of course also important to check your design in multiple screen resolutions. By
using the `screenWidth` option WebdriverCSS automatically resizes the browser for you.
By adding the screen width to the file name WebdriverCSS makes sure that only shots
with same width will be compared.

```js
client
    .url('http://stephencaver.com/')
    .webdrivercss('header', {
        elem: '#masthead',
        screenWidth: [320,640,960]
    });
```

This will capture the following image at once:

![alt text](http://webdriver.io/images/webdrivercss/header.new.960px.png "Logo Title Text 1")

**file name:** header.960px.png

![alt text](http://webdriver.io/images/webdrivercss/header.new.640px.png "Logo Title Text 1")

**file name:** header.640px.png

![alt text](http://webdriver.io/images/webdrivercss/header.new.320px.png "Logo Title Text 1")

**file name:** header.320px.png

### Synchronize your taken Images

If you want to have your image repository available regardless where you run your tests, you can
use an external API to store your shots. Therefor WebdriverCSS adds a `sync` function that downloads
the repository as tarball and unzips it. After running your tests you can call this function again
to zip the current state of your repository and upload it. Here is how this can look like:

```js
// create a WebdriverJS instance
var client = require('webdriverjs').remote({
    desiredCapabilities: {
        browserName: 'phantomjs'
    }
});

// initialise WebdriverCSS for `client` instance
require('webdrivercss').init(client, {
    screenshotRoot: 'myRegressionTests',

    // Provide the API route
    api: 'http://example.com/api/webdrivercss'
});

client
    .init()
    .sync() // downloads last uploaded tarball from http://example.com/api/webdrivercss/myRegressionTests.tar.gz
    .url('http://example.com')

    // do your regression tests
    // ...

    .sync() // zips your screenshot root and uploads it to http://example.com/api/webdrivercss via POST method
    .end();
```

This allows you to run your regression tests with the same taken shots again and again, no matter where
your tests are executed. It also makes distributed testing possible. Regressions tests can be done not only
by you but everyone else who has access to the API.

#### API Requirements

To implement such API you have to provide two routes for synchronization:

* [GET] /some/route/:file
  Should response the uploaded tarball (for example: /some/root/myProject.tar.gz)
  Content-Type: `application/octet-stream`
* [POST] /some/route
  Request contains zipped tarball that needs to be stored on the filesystem

If you don't want to implement this by yourself, there is already such an application prepared, checkout
the [webdriverio/webdrivercss-adminpanel](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdrivercss-adminpanel) project.
It provides even a web interface for before/after comparison and stuff like this.
